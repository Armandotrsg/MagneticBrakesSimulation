# Matlab App for Cinematic Graphs of Magnetic Brake System

## Description

This repository contains a Matlab App that showcases different cinematic graphs about a magnetic brake system used in a popular mechanical game called the "Free Fall Tower." The brake system is based on Faraday's Law and Eddie Currents, and it is used to decelerate a gondola in a amusement park ride. The brake system has several advantages, including frictionless braking, no energy source required, and smooth braking without jerking.

## How it Works

The magnetic brake system works by applying an electromagnetic force on the magnet as soon as it is released, which slows or brakes its movement. The magnetic force is caused by induced currents in the bar due to the variation of the magnetic flux. The braking is frictionless, which reduces maintenance requirements, and it does not require an energy source, making it safer. The braking is also smooth without jerking, making it more comfortable for passengers.

## Features

- Cinematic graphs of magnetic brake system.
- Implementation in Matlab App.
- Use of Faraday's Law and Eddie Currents.

## Installation

To run the Matlab App in this repository, you will need to have Matlab installed. You can then clone the repository and run the Matlab App in Matlab R2021a or higher.
